# PowerBI_Projects

Welcome to my Power BI Projects repository! This collection features a series of visualization projects designed to showcase my skills and expertise in Power BI. Each project demonstrates my ability to clean, model, and analyze data, transforming it into actionable insights and visually compelling dashboards. These projects serve as a testament to my ability to transform raw data into compelling visual narratives, making complex information easily accessible and understandable.
